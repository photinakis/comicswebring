# Code of Conduct

Rules for being in this webring.

(This CoC is very much a work in progress, please ping admin Maria Photinakis with any questions. Twitter: @photinakis)

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our webring a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

We will not censor artists in our webring and understand that not all content will be appropriate for all audiences, and we will provide a wide berth for all kinds of expression and artistic nudity. That said, we expect webring members to put in a good faith effort to provide a 'gate' or up-front content warnings about work that might be graphic so a visitor can easily avoid content they do not wish to see. (E.g. If you create hyper-violent or sexually explicit content, please do not submit a direct link to explicit work, but a splash page with a warning or index with a PG-13 thumbnail is fine.) 

Content that directs abuse or hate at a marginalized group of any kind will not be allowed.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Webring admins are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Admins have the right and responsibility to remove or reject members of the webring not aligned to this Code of Conduct at their sole discretion, at any time.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable content or behavior may be reported to the webring admins at mphotinakis@gmail.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The admins are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
